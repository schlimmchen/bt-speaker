    Wrapper around dbus to encapsulate the org.bluez.Device interface.
    Refer to :py:class:`BTGenericDevice` for init arguments.

    :Properties:

    * **Address(str) [readonly]**: The Bluetooth device address of the
        remote device.
    * **Name(str) [readonly]**: The Bluetooth remote name. This value can
        not be changed. Use the Alias property instead.
    * **Icon(str) [readonly]**: Proposed icon name according to the
        freedesktop.org icon naming specification.
    * **Class(str) [readonly]**: The Bluetooth class of device of the remote
        device.
    * **UUIDs(list{str}) [readonly]**: List of 128-bit UUIDs that represents
        the available remote services.
    * **Paired(boolean) [readonly]**: Indicates if the remote device is paired.
    * **Connected(boolean) [readonly]**: Indicates if the remote device is
        connected.
    * **Trusted(boolean) [readwrite]**: Indicates if the remote device is
        trusted.
    * **Alias(str) [readwrite]**: The name alias for the remote device. The
        alias can be used to have a different friendly name for the remote
        device. In case no alias is set, it will return the remote device name.
        Setting an empty string as alias will convert it back to the remote
        device name. When reseting the alias with an empty string, the emitted
        :py:attr`.SIGNAL_PROPERTY_CHANGED` signal will show the remote
        name again.
    * **Nodes(list{str}) [readonly]**: List of device node object paths.
    * **Adapter(str) [readonly]**: The object path of the adpater the device
        belongs to.
    * **LegacyPairing(boolean) [readonly]**: Set to true if the device only
        supports the pre-2.1 pairing mechanism. This property is useful in the
        :py:attr`.SIGNAL_DEVICE_FOUND` signal to anticipate whether legacy
        or simple pairing will occur. Note that this property can exhibit
        false-positives in the case of Bluetooth 2.1 (or newer) devices that
        have disabled Extended Inquiry Response support.
    * **Blocked(boolean) [readonly]**: Set to true if the device is blocked.
    * **Product(uint16) [readonly]**: Product code identifier.
    * **Vendor(uint16) [readonly]**: Product vendor identifier.
    * **Services(list{str}) [readonly]**: TBD.
