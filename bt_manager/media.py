    A media transport instance provides a mechanism by which
    data streamed to/from a device can be sent/received via
    the L2 transport.

    This is done by `acquiring` a transport file descriptor
    object which then allows the underlying file to be
    read from or written to.

    When finished, the file descriptor should be closed using
    a normal UNIX **close()** operation before `releasing` the
    media transport back again.

        any CODECs and should be regarded as providing direct

        device's file descriptor node carrying the media transport.
